* This program allows you to search for: Concerts for a band, Songs from *Spotify*, Movie info, and there's one last command that will allow you to run what the app is saying

* All of this info is being ran from node.js

* You will need to do a npm install and get your own *spotify id* and *spotify secret* to run this program on your local machine

* concert-this <Band/Artist name>
* spotify-this-song
